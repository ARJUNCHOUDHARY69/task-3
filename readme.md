Interview Questions:
Outcome: Introductory vulnerability assessment experience and understanding of common PC risks.

1. What is vulnerability scanning?
Vulnerability scanning is an automated process used to identify potential security weaknesses in systems, networks, or applications. It involves scanning devices to detect known vulnerabilities such as outdated software, misconfigurations, or missing patches.

2. Difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?
Vulnerability scanning is automated and identifies known vulnerabilities, whereas penetration testing is a manual or semi-automated process performed by security professionals to exploit vulnerabilities and determine the extent of risk.

3. What are some common vulnerabilities in personal computers?
- Unpatched operating systems
- Outdated software or applications
- Weak or reused passwords
- Disabled firewalls or antivirus
- Misconfigured services or open ports
- Malware infections

4. How do scanners detect vulnerabilities?
Scanners use a database of known vulnerabilities (such as CVEs) and compare it against system configurations, software versions, and open ports to identify matches. They may also use banner grabbing, file analysis, and patch verification techniques.

5. What is CVSS?
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a standardized framework for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities. It provides a numerical score (from 0 to 10) that helps organizations assess and prioritize risks.

6. How often should vulnerability scans be performed?
Scans should be performed regularly—typically monthly or quarterly—and also after major system changes, new deployments, or emerging threats to ensure continuous security.

7. What is a false positive in vulnerability scanning?
A false positive occurs when a scanner reports a vulnerability that does not actually exist or is not exploitable in the environment. These can waste resources and must be verified and filtered out.

8. How do you prioritize vulnerabilities?
Vulnerabilities can be prioritized based on:
- CVSS score
- Exploitability and public availability of exploits
- Asset criticality
- Impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability
- Business context and regulatory compliance
