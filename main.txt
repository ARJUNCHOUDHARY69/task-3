VULNERABILITY SCAN REPORT
==========================

Objective:
----------
Identify vulnerabilities on a local PC using OpenVAS or Nessus.

Tool Used:
----------
OpenVAS 26.0.0 (Greenbone Vulnerability Management)

Scan Target:
------------
127.0.0.1 (localhost)

Scan Duration:
--------------
~45 minutes

Date:
-----
2025-05-29

Steps Followed:
---------------
1. Installed OpenVAS (GVM) on Kali Linux:
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install gvm
   sudo gvm-setup
   sudo gvm-start

2. Synchronized Feed:
   sudo runuser -u _gvm -- greenbone-feed-sync --type NVT

3. Logged into the Web UI: https://127.0.0.1:9392

4. Created scan target: 127.0.0.1 (localhost)

5. Created scan task using profile: "Full and Fast Scan"

6. Started scan and waited approximately 45 minutes.
